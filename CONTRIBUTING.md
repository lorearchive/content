You can format your text using wiki markup. This wiki markup rule will be referred to as "syntax".

> [!NOTE]  
> Every usage manual of the Lore Archive are editable by the public, just likes its wiki content and everything else. If you can see a way to improve anything on this document, please read our guide on "How to contribute for new GitHub users" on this same document.

The syntax of the Lore Archive Wiki is a superset of the default [DokuWiki syntax](https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax), which aims to make the datafiles as readable as possible.

You should at least familiarize yourself with the basic syntax if you want to provide some kind of medium to substantial edits for the wiki. It will provide great aid in your writings and will improve boring-looking articles.

## Core Syntax
The Core Syntax is syntax provided by the wiki engine the Lore Archive Wiki uses, called [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org).

| A FIXME bookmark  | `FIXME` creates a Fix Me! emoticon, and it is a good bookmark to use when you find something which should be fixed.

A colon is a namespace separator in DokuWiki, and starting a link with the colon sets the link up for absolute pathing, instead of a relative one. E.g. if the current page is inside the namespace "Gehenna", and inside is a link like this: `[[somepage]]` you will be linked to a page with the absolute path of: `[[:gehenna:somepage]]`. Make sure all links are lowercase. | You should link to relevant wiki pages when it is mentioned in the article for the first time. Even if there are multiple mentions, refrain from linking every one of them. You may link an already-linked page only after a significant amount of text later. You can also use wikilinks to link to a page which you imply. E.g. you can link to a specific school when the article mentions "a school" |

## Extended Syntax
The Extended Syntax consists of syntax provided by third party [DokuWiki Plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) to extend the functionalities of the default core syntax further. All syntax you will need are given below, and some plugins are created by myself. You can check its source code, alongside other plugins that are not created by me that I have modified, on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorearchive/extensions/tree/main).
